            <h3>Steve</h3>
            <P>I am deeply saddened by the death of Steve Jobs. My heartfelt condolences goes out to his family, friends and the Apple family. He will surely be missed, we have lost one of the greatest human beings ever.
                <h4>Paul</h4>
                <h3>Steve blesses the world forever!</h3>
                <p>A complete human being, an admirable man, an inspiration to generations: all in one, named Steve Jobs. Thank you for changing the world for the better along with your closest partners, without whom you always repeated that nothing would have been possible. Thanks for "hangin' in there" as a true hero until the end. There are no ends... only new beginnings. Gob bless your family, who will miss you a lot, but who will also carry the eternal pride of being "yours truly". Your energy is forever alive and shared all over! Thanks for putting your knowledge and effort at work for all of us! </p><h4>Bianca  from Brazil</h4>
                <h3>You will be missed</h3>
                <p>The company you built has made me proud that these types of innovations can come from the U S of A. My sympathies to your family and may you rest in peace.

                    <p>I could talk all day about Steve. But the best way to describe him is revolutionary, idealistic, and fearless. RIP Mr.Jobs, you will be dearly missed. Sincerely, Firm Apple Supporter.

                    <h3>Steve Jobs</h3>
                    <p>Dear Apple, I was never fortunate enough to ever meet Steve, or even attend an event he was present at. However, he made a difference in my life. Knowing computer "nerds" in high school, I was "converted" to Apple to find how amazing your products are and how much easier they made my life. If it wasn't for his ideas, ideals, and dreams, none of it would be possible. I now find my current Apple products to be that much more valuable knowing that Steve played a part in their creation. The same cannot be said for every product following (though I know some are in the works and I do not doubt that Apple will continue to hold Steve's values in the future). I wish to extend my condolences to his family, friends, and to Apple. I hope you all will find peace in your hearts with time. In a reply to my own mother's death, someone told me, "We do not die when our bodies collapse, we die when we are forgotten." Steve will most certainly never be forgotten, he will live with us all forever in our hearts.

                    <p>He touched us all and gave us so much. His inventions and vision challenge and enriched our lives. I can't imagine what my life would be without Steve Jobs brilliant mind. I love my Apple "toys." I call them toys with great affection. They are all fun like toys but they are a serious part of my life. No longer is there only one way to communicate with people. I carry a little phone that entertains me with games and music, provides my e-mail, takes and displays my pictures,keeps my calendar - I can go on and on. All are fantastic. What a gift to the world. I just want to say thanks Steve Jobs. You have impacted my life.

                    <p>Steve will be truly missed. I still remember fondly how jealous I was of my first college roommate and his 12 in. PowerBook. I worked 50 hours a week the entire summer after that first year so I could purchase my own Powerbook and iPod. Today, I own a Macbook Pro, an iPod, an iPhone, an iPhone 4, an iPad 2 and an Apple TV. I just couldn't get enough and I can't thank Steve and Apple enough for bringing such enjoyment to my life.

                    <p>The world has lost an amazing person. We are all better off from his many contributions. As long as there is Apple, their products we will be doing his memory justice and in many ways he will live through each of us. My heart goes out to all his loved ones.

                        <p>I have just heard that the Lord has bought you to him. I hope you everything well. In fact, you are the person who inspired me well. I heard about lots of your story. Those stories inspired me to come to the USA to fulfill my dream. I have bought your Iphone 4 on Sep.13, 2011, I hope you and apple will make another milestone in the future. Unfortunately, the God is so like you that he has to take you there. I hope you are happy in the heaven, and use your genius and spirit to continue guide Apple to another top. My english is not as good as US citizen, but I hope you could receive my wish. I have planned to buy a ipad2 when I get enough money. I will continue to support you and your Apple. Your story and spirit will live long. Thank you!

                            <p>I am so sad to hear Steve Jobs died hours ago. I know it is so hard to have pancreas cancer because my mom died suffering that kind of cancer. Today,I learned to use Iphone and I am so proud to have it in my hands because Steve Jobs created that. May God bless him and be with him in the heaven.

                        <p>I'm just an everyday college student, I did not know Jobs personally, yet when I look back on my geeky self as a kid, my most fond, special, and important memories all somehow involve my family's apple computer. We have only ever had apple computers; it seems such an insignificant detail of my early life, but I know that without Steve Jobs and his work, I would be a completely different person. I understand he wasn't the only person working at apple, and there are many others to thank, yet his was the face that I knew and recognized as a child. So I thank you Steve Jobs, you have had a profound effect on my life. RIP Steve Jobs

Steve Jobs and Apple transformed our lives and I feel his loss so personally as if I knew him. My heart goes out to his family and co-workers. We all have lost a remarkable human being and the world will just not be the same without him in it.

I guess no one can go on forever, I guess all the money in the world can't buy health. However, if there is somewhere else and Steve is looking down, I hope he has a smile on his his face for the job he's done enriching so many lives with his great vision. Thanks for everything Mr Jobs

I will keep tryin' to still think different! “You know, my main reaction to this money thing is that it’s humorous, all the attention to it, because it’s hardly the most insightful or valuable thing that’s happened to me.” -Steve Jobs “Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn’t matter to me … Going to bed at night saying we’ve done something wonderful… that’s what matters to me.” -Steve Jobs RIP Steve Jobs
